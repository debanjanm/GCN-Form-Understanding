Wigand Supervisor / Manager Discontinue coal retention analyses on licensee submitted product samples (Note : Coal Retention testing is not performed by most licensees.

The trend seems to be increasingly specific, when we should be getting more general. Right now, people must work to understand the system. We must spend too much time adninistering the system, labeling and cleaning our files. Complying is a real burden, both for the individual and for the records coordinators. Describe Possible Solutions And Benefits 1. Drop the category specifications altogether. 2. Use moregeneral categories. hote: I have passed this to Scott Appleton for the task force to use in streamlining the records management program.

The CTS400 has the additional measurement of cigarette hardness in comparison with the CTS300. With this added, measurement R&D will be able to replace the Firmness Integrator that measures cigarette firmness in addition to other measurements that are mentioned above. The Firmness Integrator is no longer manufactured and parts are becoming difficult to obtain. Lastly, purchase of this instrument would provide similar capability as the Macon Plant and help facilitate comparisions between laboratories.

Please note that the last 2 pages are at the alternate versions that we discussed. Take a look at the alternate Q9 to try to get at the intensity issue, and maybe we can improve on it from here. By the way, we received 13 more signature cards today and sent the cigarettes out. We are now up to 74 respondents who have been sent cigarettes. Hopefully we will get a lot of callbacks this weekend. Talk you Monday.
